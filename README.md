# Adders-Mania
it contains the implementation, synthesis of different Adders written in Verilog 

Adders implemented. 
- Carry Save Adder
- Carry Lookahead Adder 
- Carry Select Adder
- Carry Skip Adder
- Ripple Carry Adder 
- Carry increment Adder

And used the best of them to implement a floating-point adder (single precision) 
- Truncation is used so there is a relatively large error  
- overflow and underflow will cause an error signal
